          <p class="text">
            This map shows the total energy consumption in Australian states.
            Larger states like New South Wales and Victoria generally have

          <p class="text">
            energy demands due to larger populations and economic activities.
            This Map highlights the idea that larger states in have
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            higher energy consumption in genral becuase of thier size. You can
            click on the year you want to see the consumption for each state(I
            could not get the slider to work on this map).

          <p class="text">
            This map shows energy consumption per capita, offering a comparison
            of how much energy is used relative to the population of each state.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Even states with high total consumption like New South Wales may
            have lower consumption per capita. This map highlights that they are

          <p class="text">
            two sides to the story as with the the map on the left you see that
            New South Wales have a higher consumption but when you look at this

      <h2>Cumulative Frequency Distribution</h2>
      <div id="cumulative_chart" class="graph"></div>
      <p class="text">
        The cumulative frequency distribution chart shows the total energy
        consumption accumulating over the years, providing a broader picture of
        trends in energy usage across states. We can see that Energry
        consumption is increseasing for all the States, which underscores that
        as the years increase we can expect the energy consumption to
        inscrease.Thus this Map is good for predicting as energy consumption has
        been increasing for all the States for the last 13 years.

        The stacked area chart compares energy consumption across Australian
        states. It highlights the relative contribution of each state to the
        total energy usage in Australia over the years.You can click on a state
        on the legend on the right side to isolate that State.

      <div id="bar_graph" class="graph"></div>
      <p class="text">
        This bar chart allows you to filter energy consumption by state based on
        their population size. You can interact with the graph by seeing the
        Average of that State or States. You can see the Average number just
        below the graph in red text.

      <h2>Interactive Bubble Chart</h2>
      <div id="interactive_bubble_chart" class="graph"></div>
      <p class="text">
        The interactive bubble chart shows the relationship between population
        size and energy consumption across Australian states. The size of the
        bubbles indicates total energy consumption for each state, while the
        x-axis represents population. We can see that the population size
        greatly influences the total energy consumption for that State.As we can
        see that both New South Wales and Victoria having the highest
        populations both have the highest energy consumption as opose to
        Tasimina having the lowest population and the lowest energy consumption.
        You can use the slider to see through the years from 2010 to 2023.

      <p>
        This bar chart allows you to filter energy consumption by state based on
        their population size. It offers insight into how population levels
        might influence the energy needs of different regions as we see that New
        South Wales and Victoria once again are the highest enegry consumption
        but this time wee see the reason why they do?.We see that energy
        consumption for both New South Wales and Victoria is high as a result of
        thier population. This looks at their population rather than per capita.
        consumption for them is
